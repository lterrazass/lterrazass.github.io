## Bio

Luis Terrazas-Salgado is a PhD candidate at the Research Center in Food and Development in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa, Mexico. He studies the effects of xenobiotics on endocrine, embryonic and epigenomic disruption in zebrafish. 
My research use a zebrafish, to characterize molecular mechanisms underpinning potential impacts of xenobiotics on human and animal health.
